# TicTacToe

TicTacToe is a simple two player strategy game. <br />

- Each player has a symbol, either X or O. 
- The player that starts the game has the symbol X. 
- The game is played on a three by three board
- The goal is to get three identical symbols in a straight line. 
- The line can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. 
- The player that has a line of three symbols is the winner.  
- The game ends in a draw if the board fills without a three symbol line.
